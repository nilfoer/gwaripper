the subreddits gonewilaudio and pillowtalkaudio. Going through reddits preferred since more post information can
be saved, if a selftext is present it will be saved alongside the audio file. Searching reddit and downloading
submissions by certain redditors is also supported. Saves the info of downloaded files in a csv and json file."""
