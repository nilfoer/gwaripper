Gonewildaudio Ripper

Script to rip audio files mainly from soundgasm.net but it also supports chirb.it and free
eraudica.com audios. Able download single links or entire users. Links can also be obtained by scanning subs in
the subreddits gonewilaudio and pillowtalkaudio. Going through reddits preferred since more post information can
be saved, if a selftext is present it will be saved alongside the audio file. Searching reddit and downloading
submissions by certain redditors is also supported. Saves the info of downloaded files in a sqlite database but
also exports it to csv to be human-readable.

Call script with -h to show info of available commands!
